# Single Player Rummy Game with Dice and Custom Deck

This project is a Python-based **Single Player Rummy Game** developed as part of the ITI 1121 - Introduction to Computing II course. The game features custom mechanics for shuffling, dealing cards, alternating turns between the player and the computer (Robot), and removing card pairs. The primary goal is to efficiently implement game logic while ensuring smooth user interaction.

## Features
- **Custom deck of cards**: Includes both standard cards and dice mechanics.
- **Alternating turns**: Game alternates between the player (Human) and the computer (Robot).
- **Game logic**: Handles pairing of cards and removal of pairs to progress the game.
- **User input validation**: Ensures valid input from the player during the game.


Project Structure

a4_Single-Player-Rummy-Game-with-Dice-and-Custom-Deck.py: Main game file where the game logic is implemented.
Helper functions:
deal_cards(): Deals cards to both Robot and Human.
remove_pairs(): Removes matching pairs from a player's hand.
print_deck(): Displays the current deck for the Human player.
get_valid_input(): Validates input from Human player.


Key Concepts

Function Design: Decomposed the game logic into smaller, manageable functions.
Game Logic: Implemented efficient algorithms for pairing and removing cards.
User Input Handling: Ensured robust and error-free interaction with the user.
